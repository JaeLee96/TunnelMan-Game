# TunnelMan-Game

It is a TunnelMan video game created in C++.

Player has to dig through the dirts to collect as many oils as it can, while avoiding protesters, in order to complete each level.
To interrupt player's mission, there will be protesters who will follow user and shout at him until user's 
health points drop zero (in which case player loses a life).

There are three items plyaer can use to help him acheve his mission: golds, water guns, and sonar kits.

Player can use drop golds by pressing 'Tab' to bribe protesters to either leave the game or to be stunned for temporary time (it depends what type of protester it is).

If protesters get nearby, player can also shoot water guns to stun protesters, by pressing 'space', in which case, they will if shot sufficiently, will die.

Lastly, protesters can also use sonar kits by pressing key 'z', which will reveal hidden items buried deep within dirts.

Player can also press 'f' to freeze the game and 'q' to quit the game prematurely.

This project was completed on August 23rd, 2018.
